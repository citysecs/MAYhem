# FAQ


## So whatâ€™s this MAYhem all about now?
The answer is very simple: we wanted to create something to cheer up the cyber security
community. MAYhem is a joint effort by the CitySecs of the cold North.

## Does it cost anything to participate?
Zero, zilch, zip, nil, nought, nothing. You can high five us later.


## Saw some cool stickers made especially for the event. Where can I get one?

Depending on which CitySec area you live in, you'll get one from your CitySec representative. The existing CitySecs are listed here [https://www.citysec.fi](https://www.citysec.fi)
